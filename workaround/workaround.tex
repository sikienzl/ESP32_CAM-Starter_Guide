If you run the flash command and you got a Timed Out
\begin{lstlisting}
$ idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash
Executing action: flash
...
esptool.py v3.3-dev
Serial port /dev/ttyUSB0
Connecting..................
...

A fatal error occurred: Failed to connect to ESP32: Timed out waiting for packet header

\end{lstlisting}
you should check if you have problems with the 5V output on your FTDI-board. If yes, you should modify your setup by an external power supply on the 5V pin on the board (see \ref{ESP32-S-CAM-setup-with-external-5v}).
